# CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python (CS50P)

This repository contains my solutions and projects for the [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) course offered by Harvard University. The course covers the fundamentals of programming using Python and includes various problem sets and projects to build a solid foundation in computer science.

## Overview

CS50P is an entry-level course that teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include:

- Functions, arguments, and variables
- Conditionals and loops
- Data structures: lists, dictionaries, and sets
- Object-oriented programming
- File I/O
- Regular expressions
- Testing and debugging
